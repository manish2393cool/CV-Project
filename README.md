# ABSTRACT
A support vector machine(SVM) is widely used as a classification task. SVM generates a hyperplane between two classes. But there are many such examples in real life that data is not always linearly separable. So kernel methods (or kernel tricks) are used for making a non-linear classifier from a linear classifier. Kernel methods transform input feature vector to another so that SVM can fit hyperplane more accurately.
